# Traffic-Sign-Detection


We have used the GTSRB german traffic sign data set.

This can be downloaded at http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/Dataset/GTSRB_Final_Training_Images.zip

Unzip the files and place the signs you want to classify in the data dir of the folders below: 
1.all_signs_combined - will handle all types of signs
2.speed_limit_detection - specically tuned for detecting speed limit signs.
execute the train.py to train the model
and eval.py to test the trained model
